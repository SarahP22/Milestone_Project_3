Analysis of US avocados from 2015-2018 (MP3DML-01)

This code was written as part of a final project for NJIT's Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp. Because we only have 2 days to form and complete this project, I worked backwards; I found a dataset that fits the criteria while still being interesting. On Kaggle I found an Avocado price and consumption data set from 2015-2018

My Milestone Project 3 Research Question Is:

    Which of the given features influence the price of avocados the most?
    
This will help stakeholders understand and predict where how to make money on avocado sales.
